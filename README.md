**This is the repository for Event Relationship (ERS) Diagrams.**

This repo contains all plugins for ERS including those from the previously separate ERS-Diagrams and ERS-Java-Generator repositories.
It is intended to integrate ERS Diagrams into the UML-B family of diagram tools.

## Plugins Description

The plugins that describe the ERS-Daigram Editor are the following :
* *ac.soton.eventb.atomicitydecomposition* : describes the ERS-diagram meta-model
* *ac.soton.eventb.atomicitydecomposition.design* : Sirius-based ERS-diagram editor (describes the editor + the ERS/Activity Diagram view)
* *ac.soton.eventb.atomicitydecomposition.design.layout* : Layout algorithm for the Sirius-based ERS-Diagram Editor
* *ac.soton.eventb.atomicitydecomposition.diagram* : GMF based ERS-diagram editor (old version) => (to be deleted ?)
* *ac.soton.eventb.atomicitydecomposition.diagram.layout* : Layout algorithm for the GMF-based ERS-Diagram Editor (old version) => (to be deleted ?)

**note : other plugins description should be added here.**

## Documentation

In this repository, you can find the user and developer documentation in the following files :
 - DeveloperDocumentation.md : Contains some tips about how to setup your Development Environment, and how to use Sirius.
 Read it to get some information that should help you to contribute on this project.
 - DeveloperDocumentation_ERS_Diagram_Specific.md : Extensive documentation that describes the Sirius-based ERS Diagram Editor Specification, and how it works overall.
 - UserDocumentation.md : User-oriented documentation that explains the main features of the ERS Editor. Useful if you just want to use the tool without having to know everything about it.
